# Babylon.js Web Engine

## Overview
Advanced web-based 3D engine with professional features and Microsoft backing.

## Status
ðŸš§ **PLANNED** - Estimated completion: Q2 2025

## Features (Planned)
- Professional 3D rendering
- PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials
- Advanced lighting systems
- Animation system
- Physics integration
- VR/AR support
- Node-based material editor
- Inspector tools

## Advantages
- Professional-grade features
- Microsoft-backed development
- Excellent tooling ecosystem
- TypeScript support
- Advanced rendering pipeline

## Considerations
- Larger file size than Three.js
- More complex API
- Higher system requirements
- Steeper learning curve

## System Requirements
- Modern browser with WebGL 2.0 support
- 8GB RAM recommended
- Dedicated GPU preferred
- Network connection for CDN assets

## Development Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Basic Babylon.js setup and integration
2. **Phase 2**: Cosmic data integration
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced materials and lighting
4. **Phase 4**: VR/AR support
5. **Phase 5**: Inspector tools integration
